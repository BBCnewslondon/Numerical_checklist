# Atomic Physics Checklist

A web checklist that captures key concepts, derivations, and equations from my atomic physics lecture module.

## Features

- Atomic-themed layout with chapter cards and per-section highlights.
- Persistent progress tracking via `localStorage` with a one-click reset.
- Chapter and overall completion indicators to focus revision.
- MathJax-powered rendering for LaTeX-style equations.
- Collapsible derivation dropdowns with step-by-step explanations and supporting math.
- Equations rendered inline using accessible HTML-friendly notation.

## Getting Started

1. Serve the folder with any static web server (for example `npx serve`, the VS Code Live Server extension, or `python -m http.server`).
2. Visit `http://localhost:PORT/index.html` in a modern browser and work through the checklistâ€”progress is saved automatically on this device.
3. Use the **Reset All** button to clear the checklist when you want to start fresh.

No build steps are required; the project is entirely static.
